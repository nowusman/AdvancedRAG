#  Retriever

This module implements the Retrieval (R) component of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system basically using **LlamaIndex**. It is responsible for retrieving the most relevant document nodes from various data sources. 

MongoDB is utilized as the database for storage in this system. The frontend is created by **Streamlit**.

##  Features

-  Comprehensive document management with capabilities for uploading and deleting files.
-  Broad format compatibility, supporting images (JPG, PNG), documents (DOCX, PDF), and more.
-  Complete document ingestion pipeline ensuring seamless processing and indexing.
-  Robust data storage powered by MongoDB for scalability and reliability.
-  Intelligent, multi-modal retrieval enabling advanced search across different content types.
-  Simple, clean Streamlit chat UI.

## Tech for Retriever
| Index/Retriever                | Purpose                             |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **VectorIndex**                | Enables semantic text search        |
| **BM25Retriever**              | Performs keyword-based text retrieval using the BM25 algorithm |
| **QueryFusionRetriever**       | Combines results from VectorIndex and BM25Retriever to improve overall text search accuracy. |
| **MultiModalVectorStoreIndex** | Handles embeddings to support cross-modal retrieval.           |
| **RouterRetriever**            | Dynamically selects the most appropriate retriever (text or multi-modal) based on the query.   |


### Why LlamaIndex

-  Unified framework – Simplifies integration of multiple retrievers (vector, keyword, multimodal, etc.) in one cohesive system.
-  Flexible data connectors – Easily ingest data from various sources without heavy custom code.
-  Composable architecture – Allows to mix and match retrievers, indexes, and query strategies to fit complex use cases.
-  Multi-modal support – Built-in capabilities for handling text, images, and other data types through vector embeddings.
-  Query routing and fusion – Provides native tools like RouterRetriever and QueryFusionRetriever for smarter retrieval pipelines.
-  Rapid prototyping – Abstracts low-level complexities, enabling faster development and experimentation.
